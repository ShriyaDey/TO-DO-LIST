This project is a basic to-do list application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a simple yet functional web app that helps users manage their daily tasks effectively.

Technologies Used:
HTML: Structures the app's content and defines the elements, such as task input fields and buttons.
CSS: Styles the app with clean and modern design elements, including hover effects, color schemes, and layout adjustments for different screen sizes.
JavaScript: Powers the app's functionality, handling user interactions like adding, removing, and marking tasks as completed. JavaScript also manages dynamic updates to the task list.

How It Works:
Add Tasks: Users can enter a task in the input field and press the "Add" button to add the task to their list.
Delete Tasks: Users can delete individual tasks, keeping their list clean and focused on what matters.
